SWI-Prolog License Conditions

Preamble

SWI-Prolog licensing aims at a large audience, combining ideas from the Free Software Foundation and the less principal Open Source Initiative. The license aims at the following:

Make SWI-Prolog itself and its libraries `As free as possible'.
Allow for easy integration of contributions.
Free software can build on SWI-Prolog without limitations.
Non-free (open or proprietary) software can be produced using SWI-Prolog, although contributed pure GPL components cannot be used.
To achieve this, different parts of the system have different licenses. SWI-Prolog programs consist of a mixture of `native' code (source compiled to machine instructions) and `virtual machine' code (Prolog source compiled to SWI-Prolog virtual machine instructions, covering both compiled SWI-Prolog libraries and your compiled application).
